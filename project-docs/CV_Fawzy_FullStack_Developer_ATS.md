Additional Expertise
Beyond full stack development, I bring 6 years of hands-on experience as a Senior Network Professional (Fortinet ecosystem, Cisco, infrastructure). This unique combination ensures applications are designed with security-first architecture and deep understanding of enterprise IT environments.
Note: Many projects listed above (Enterprise Portal, Corporate Websites, FUT Coins Miner, and earlier work) were developed entirely before the AI-assisted coding era, demonstrating strong foundational programming skills and problem-solving capabilities.
