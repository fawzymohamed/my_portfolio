title: About
description: A Security-First Digital Architect with 14+ years of experience bridging Network Security and Full Stack Development.
content: |
  I am **Fawzy Mohamed Fawzy**, a Senior Full Stack Developer and Network Security Professional based in **Riyadh, Saudi Arabia**. My journey is defined by a unique convergence of infrastructure security and software architectures.
  
  Unlike typical developers, I bring **6 years of hands-on experience as a Senior Network Professional**, managing Fortinet ecosystems, Cisco infrastructure, and enterprise data centers. This background allows me to build applications that are not just functional, but inherently secure and optimized for the network layer.

  ### My Core Philosophy: "Zero-Cost Operations"

  I specialize in building self-hosted, automated ecosystems. At **ALKHOLI Group**, I transformed operations by replacing expensive SaaS subscriptions with custom-built, on-premise solutions. From **Stock Management Systems** to **AI-Powered Automation** and **Email Security**, I deliver enterprise-grade performance with **$0 operational cost**.

  ### Technical Expertise

  - **Frontend:** Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Svelte (Advanced)
  - **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, SQL (MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  - **Security:** FortiGate, FortiEDR, SSL/TLS Management, WAF
  - **AI & Automation:** Groq AI Integration, n8n Workflows, LLM Prompt Engineering

  ### The Pre-AI Era Foundation

  It is important to note: **Many of my most complex systems—including the Enterprise Portal and Corporate Websites—were architected and coded entirely before the AI-assisted era.** This demonstrates a deep, fundamental understanding of programming logic and system design that goes beyond modern tool reliance.

  I am currently open to full-time roles, freelance contracts, and technical consulting.
